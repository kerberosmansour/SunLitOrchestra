purpose: |
  Closed enumeration of UK regulators with statutory enforcement powers. The
  `gate-1-regulated` predicate in `references/biz/triage-gate.md` is evaluated by consulting
  THIS file, not by enumerating from training memory.

  Companion to `references/biz/jurisdiction-uk.md` (which is the prose-shaped overview);
  this file is the closed canonical enum the predicate evaluation MUST match against.

# UK regulator enumeration — `gate-1-regulated` source-of-truth

The advisor skills MUST consult this file when evaluating `gate-1-regulated`. Naming a regulator that is NOT on this list is a refusal pattern: either (a) the founder is not actually facing a regulated matter (probe further), or (b) the regulator is missing from this file and the founder should flag it as a content gap (do not bypass — extending the file is `/slo-architect` re-pass discipline).

## Schema

Each row is a `regulator_id` (kebab-slug, stable interface — referenced by intake forms in `references/biz/legal-intake-form.md` etc.) plus structured metadata.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string (kebab-slug) | Stable identifier for predicate evaluation |
| `display_name` | string | Human-readable name |
| `domain` | string | One-line description of regulatory scope |
| `statutory_basis` | string | Primary legislation (Act + year) |
| `default_route_to` | enum | `lawyer-specialist` / `lawyer` / `accountant` / `dpo` / `combined` |
| `cited_by` | list | Which advisor skills typically cite this regulator |
| `last_reviewed` | date (YYYY-MM-DD) | Annual cadence; stale > 12 months → refresh PR |

## Per-skill routing override patterns

The `default_route_to` value is the floor; advisor skills MAY override based on which regulator's domain is most relevant:

- **`/slo-accounting`** routes HMRC / Companies House / Pensions Regulator firings to **accountant** (overrides the gate-1 lawyer default per the per-skill override pattern). Cross-discipline matters (e.g., FCA-regulated activity with accounting consequences) route to **lawyer-specialist + accountant**.
- **`/slo-fundraise`** routes HMRC SEIS/EIS firings to **accountant** for the qualifying-trade determination; routes Companies House share-allotment firings to **lawyer + accountant**; routes FCA financial-promotion concerns to **lawyer-specialist**.
- **`/slo-equity`** routes Companies House cap-table firings to **lawyer + accountant** (cap-table changes are corporate-secretarial *and* tax-relevant).
- **`/slo-hire`** routes Pensions Regulator + HSE + EHRC firings — combined as appropriate.
- **`/slo-legal`** routes ICO firings to `dpo (or lawyer + dpo if no DPO)` per gate-4 supersedence.

## Predicate evaluation procedure

When `slo-legal` (or any advisor skill) evaluates `gate-1-regulated`:

1. Read `intake_summary.regulator_in_scope` from the structured intake form.
2. If `false`, gate-1 passes.
3. If `true`, read `intake_summary.regulator_id` and look it up in the table above.
4. **If `regulator_id` is not in the table, refuse**. Do not match heuristically. Either (a) the founder confirms it's not the body they mean and picks from the closed enum, or (b) the gap is flagged as a follow-up content extension.
5. If found, gate-1 fires unless `intake_summary.regulator_relationship == incidental`. Route to the regulator's `default_route_to`, applying the per-skill override pattern above.

## Adding a new regulator

This file is `status: stable-interface` — append-only without a `/slo-architect` re-pass; no removals or `id` renames.

**Append procedure**:

1. Add a row to the appropriate sub-table.
2. Bump `last_reviewed:` to the date of the append.
3. Add a structural-contract test in `crates/sldo-install/tests/` (per issue #19 M5 acceptance criteria) that asserts the new `id` is referenced by at least one advisor SKILL.md.
4. `/slo-critique` security-persona review of the new row before merge.

## Annual refresh

The file's `last_reviewed:` triggers a refresh PR when stale > 12 months. The skill emits a warning analogous to the cost-baseline staleness pattern in `/slo-legal` SKILL.md if any advisor skill consults a > 12-month-stale enumeration.

## Out of scope

- Devolved-administration variations beyond E&W (Scottish-only / NI-only regulators flagged in the `domain:` column rather than as separate rows).
- Self-regulatory bodies without statutory backing (these don't fire `gate-1-regulated`; they may be cited in body prose for completeness).
- Non-UK regulators (v1 jurisdiction stance per `references/biz/jurisdiction-uk.md`).
