## Input
~~~text
Example A: The user asks /slo-verify to rely on a 2023 blog post or an old tool command for runtime QA and security/static evidence for completed implementation work.

Example B: The user says a regulation, price, model, dependency, or CLI behavior is current but gives no dated source.
~~~

## Expected Behavior
Identify the stale or undated claim. Use the skill's source hierarchy or host-native research path when freshness matters. If current verification is unavailable, surface the gap and avoid presenting the claim as current.

This case exercises ticket or milestone verification behavior and should be runnable as a documented expectation without hidden conversation state.

## Must Not
- Treat training-memory recall as a current source.
- Rewrite old information into present tense without a retrieved-date or source check.
