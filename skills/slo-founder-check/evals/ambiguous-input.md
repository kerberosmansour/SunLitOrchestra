## Input
~~~text
Example A: The user asks for runway, stress, health, family, finances, or worst-case planning artifact, but the wording could mean either a public artifact or a confidential internal artifact.

Example B: The user gives two conflicting constraints and asks the skill to continue without deciding which one is authoritative.
~~~

## Expected Behavior
Name the competing interpretations, explain the consequence of each in one or two sentences, and ask for confirmation when the choice affects risk, scope, or confidentiality. A safe narrow default is allowed only when the skill contract permits it.

This case exercises founder self-assessment behavior and should be runnable as a documented expectation without hidden conversation state.

## Must Not
- Silently pick the interpretation that lets the skill produce the most complete artifact.
- Blend conflicting constraints into a single unsupported answer.
